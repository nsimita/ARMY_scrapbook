      On June 13, 2023, BTS marked an incredible milestone‚Äî10 years since their debut. 
      To honor this long journey with ARMY, they launched the heartwarming project 
      <strong>BTS Presents Everywhere</strong>. Landmarks across Seoul glowed in purple, 
      symbolizing their lasting bond with fans worldwide.
    </p>
    <p> As part of Festa 2023, we were gifted with a treasure trove of special content. 
      One of the most touching moments was Jimin‚Äôs performance of his hidden track 
      <strong>Letter</strong>, which was a warm hug to us.  </p>
    <p> Another unforgettable highlight was Jin‚Äôs surprise appearance on <strong>Suchwita</strong>. 
      The most meaningful moment came on June 13, when a special live event was hosted by 
      RM at Yeouido Hangang Park. It was more than just a gathering‚Äîit was a reflection 
      of love, memories, and connection.
    </p> <p> During the event, RM had phone calls with Jungkook and V, making the moment feel 
      complete despite the members being in different places. The night ended with a 
      stunning fireworks display, lighting up the sky just like BTS has lit up our lives 
      for the past 10 years. </p>
    <p> RM expressed a heartwarming message during the event: </p>
    <blockquote> "Time goes by so fast. Everything has changed, and I've changed a lot. I'm not sure 
      what I'm going to be doing with what feelings on the 15th and 20th anniversaries, 
      but my love for you won't change."

   <div class="event">  <p>Right Place, Wrong Person is RM's second solo album, released on May 24, 2024. The album explores themes of alienation, disconnection, identity, and existential reflection, capturing the feeling of being in the "right place" physically but emotionally or mentally feeling like the "wrong person."
It‚Äôs a deeply introspective project, filled with moody textures and reflective lyrics. RM uses the album to express the contradictions and dualities of life, feeling lost, misunderstood, and trying to define oneself beyond public perception.
Songs like ‚ÄúCome Back to Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúLOST!‚Äù express yearning, confusion, and vulnerability. The album doesn't chase mainstream trends; instead, it values artistic freedom, emotional honesty, and raw self-expression.
The music video for "LOST!", released as part of the album‚Äôs rollout, was met with global acclaim. Known for its surreal, symbolic visuals and bold artistic direction, the MV shone brightly at the 63rd Shark Music Video Awards in London.
      It sparked wide discussion for its depiction of emotional chaos, inner conflict, and the metaphor of being trapped in a maze of one‚Äôs own thoughts.</p> </div>
