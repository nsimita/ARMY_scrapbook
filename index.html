      On June 13, 2023, BTS marked an incredible milestone‚Äî10 years since their debut. 
      To honor this long journey with ARMY, they launched the heartwarming project 
      <strong>BTS Presents Everywhere</strong>. Landmarks across Seoul glowed in purple, 
      symbolizing their lasting bond with fans worldwide.
    </p>
    <p> As part of Festa 2023, we were gifted with a treasure trove of special content.

      <strong>Letter</strong>, which was a warm hug to us.  </p>
    <p> Another unforgettable highlight was Jin‚Äôs surprise appearance on <strong>Suchwita</strong>. 
      The most meaningful moment came on June 13, when a special live event was hosted by 
      RM at Yeouido Hangang Park. It was more than just a gathering‚Äîit was a reflection 
      of love, memories, and connection.
    </p> <p> During the event, RM had phone calls with Jungkook and V, making the moment feel 
      complete despite the members being in different places. The night ended with a 
      stunning fireworks display, lighting up the sky just like BTS has lit up our lives 
      for the past 10 years. </p>
    <p> RM expressed a heartwarming message during the event: </p>
    <blockquote> "Time goes by so fast. Everything has changed, and I've changed a lot. I'm not sure 
      what I'm going to be doing with what feelings on the 15th and 20th anniversaries,
